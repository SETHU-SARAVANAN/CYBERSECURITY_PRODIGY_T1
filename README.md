# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Cybersecurity Internship Task 1

This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The task was to **implement the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python**, enabling both encryption and decryption of text based on a user-defined shift value.

## 📜 Task Description
**Implement Caesar Cipher**  
Create a Python program that:
- Encrypts text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
- Decrypts text back to the original message
- Accepts a message and a shift value as inputs

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **Encrypt messages** with a given shift value
- **Decrypt messages** back to their original form
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves spaces and punctuation

## 🛠️ How It Works
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the text is shifted a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Example:
